  <p><b>The Challenge</b> Master Blockchain, Machine Learning, and Industry APIs and Open Source Technology while competing in a four-month virtual hackathon. <b>Our Solution</b> We are building The Spot Exchange: a smart, decentralized, blockchain-based marketplace on Hyperledger Fabric on the IBM Z platform. The Spot Exchange enables people to rent physical locations designated for parking traditional and autonomous vehicles. Parking spaces include garages, lots, alleyways, and driveways, which may be located on private residential and commercial property.</p>
